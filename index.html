			<p>Desislava Nikolova</p>
			<p>Residential</p>
			<p>Desislava is 34-years old, married with one child, originally from Bulgaria and has a thick accent.  She works on the weekends as a children's hair stylist, attends 
			an online college for Media Communications and has not seen her family in Bulgaria in over a year.  Her parents will be coming in January and she wants to have a welcome 
			banner created for their arrival and welcoming party.  However, the sign needs to be printed in a Cyrillic font and written in Bulgarian since her parents do not speak english.
			She plans to provide the text to the sign company of her choice after viewing their respective portfolios on her MacBook Pro and iPhone 5 and would like to conduct business by 
			email due to her accent sometimes causing confusion.</p>

			<p>Bryan Gill</p>
			<p>Commercial</p>
			<p>Bryan is 38-years old and married with one child.  He in the 18th year of his career as an IT professional.  He is in the process of starting a web design company called 
			Space Coast Design Studio and is looking for a sign for his office space and advertising material.  He would like to keep the sign and advertising material with one company 
			to minimize the number of companies he needs to interact with to get the job done.  Bryan currently has a full time job and attends an online college for web design.  He also 
			takes care of his family and has very little free time.  He plans on reviewing information and portfolios on PCs, MacBook Pro, and iPhone 5 for three sign companies and will 
			call to schedule an appointment to get the process started.</p>
